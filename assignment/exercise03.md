# Exercise: Response time measurement and cloud upload

The LED blinks at random intervals.
The exercise_game.py script measures response time.

## Questions

1. Edit the exercise_game.py code to compute average, minimum, maximum response time for 10 flashes total.
2. Upload the response time data to a cloud service of your choice.


##Solution
1. We used the native built in math functions min and max to take the min and max of the list of scores. Additionally, we used the values of N and the native sum function to ultimately calculate the mean and the score. We then saved these values to a json file prepared to for part 2.

2.
